-map ideas-
fountain with water and water particles
two statues made of marble material or something
probably just a glass wall
skybox with transparent windows maybe
have a door covered in fire


-story-
im in castle room
then maybe i go in sewer, make it a little foggy
then i go to an outside area
then i go into disco, neon room, some lights are pusling and changing colors, disco ball
then im at a the line sorround by lava some cool platformers
then the final room 
then the endings the grassy area with tree and sun
can have metal boxes maybe be reflecting a cubemap texture
one part I can have glass boxes by using the cubemap and refracting it on some texture

can have steam particles going through roof
maybe make area where you walk through steam particles

boss will be mecha barney his head is still alive but mecha body
enemies can be billy mays and toilets
can make a bathroom stage
enemies can just be possesed kids as zombies
evil cupids
probably more platforms though less enemies
if theres enemies they will probably just charge at you and you shoot them
also in some platforms i can make it so you have to shoot things to activate others

-boss-
mecha barney
you have to shoot his armor off
then you can kill him
he has lazers and demons
lil pump is dead in the corner
