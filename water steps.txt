-water steps-
1.) Create two fbos and fill them correctly
2.) test to make sure the color buffers work by creating 2 guis and using the textures
3.) now position the cameras correctly for the render pass
4.) create the correct clip planes for the render pass
5.) set up all uniforms,etc
6.) now test to see if color buffers both show the clip planes working and from right angles
7.) now mix the colors and actually render them to the water and see if it works
8.) now use projective texturing to see if it works by transforming it to clip space
